        #LOC_wd_prop_engine_s1_1_description = Just don't stand in front of it. The Y12 represents the next evolution in piston engine design, boasting great fuel efficiency, as well as high performance where it matters. Uniquely, the thrust-reverser mechanism can be used while the engine is running, however this may prove to be a poor design choice.
