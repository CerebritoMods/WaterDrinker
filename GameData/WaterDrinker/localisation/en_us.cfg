        #LOC_wd_electric_prop_engine_s0_1_description = At the cost of many batteries, this electric prop can produce thrust, without combustion! You still need an atmosphere, obviously.

        #LOC_wd_prop_engine_s1_1_description = Just don't stand in front of it. The Y12 represents the next evolution in Turboprop design, boasting great fuel efficiency, as well as high performance where it matters. Uniquely, the thrust-reverser mechanism can be used while the engine is running, however this may prove to be a poor design choice.
